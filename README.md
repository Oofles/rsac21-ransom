Do not feel the need to rush. This github repo and the associated lab environments will be up through the end of the day.

Modify public golang ransomware code, with different techniques to prepare multiple samples. Now you to are a malware author ;).

[Detection](LAB_FILES/detection.md)

Now it is game time. Execute ironcat family malware and simulate live reponse to a ransomware incident, and the code and malicious activity that is left behind.
